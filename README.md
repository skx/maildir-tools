# maildir-utils

In the past I've written a couple of console-based email clients, and I always found the user-interface the hardest part.

This repository contains a simple proof of concept for a different approach towards email clients:

* Instead of a monolithic "mail-client" why not compose one from pieces?

> This is basically the motivation and history behind MH-E.

I can imagine a UI which is nothing more than a bunch of shell-scripts, perhaps using `dialog` to drive them:

* In one state it just runs a shell-command to list folders, and lets you move a cursor up and down.
* In another state it might just run a shell-command to list messages in the folder you've chosen
  * And allow you to move the cursor up and down.
* In the final state it might just run a shell-command to display a message.
  * And allow you to hit keys to mark read, reply, etc.

This should be almost trivial to write.  Right?  The hardest part would be handling the sorting of messages into threads, etc.



# Usage

There are currently several sub-commands available:

* `maildir-utils maildirs`
  * This lists all your maildir folders, recursively.
* `maildir-utils messages`
  * This lists the messages inside a folder.
  * Handling the output in a flexible fashion.
* `maildir-utils message`
  * This formats and outputs a single message.
  * If a `text/plain` part is available then display that.
  * Otherwise use `text/html` if available.
  * Otherwise no dice.
* `maildir-utils ui`
  * Toy user-interface that proves we could make something of ourselves.

With the ability to view folders, message-lists, and a single message we almost have enough to be a functional mail-client.  Albeit one within which you cannot compose, delete, or reply to a message.

Most of the sub-commands default to looking in `~/Maildir` but the `-prefix /path/to/root` will let you change the directory.  Maildirectories are handled recursively, and things are pretty fast but I guess local SSDs help with that.  For everything else there is always the option to cache things.


# Sub-Commands

This is a simple proof of concept, it might become more useful, it might become abandoned.

Currently this project will build a single monolithic binary with a couple of sub-commands, run with no arguments to see usage information.


## `maildir-utils maildirs`

This will output a list of maildir directories, by default showing the complete path of each maildir which was found.

```
$ maildir-utils maildirs --format '${name}' | grep debian-packages
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-Pkg-javascript-devel
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-aatv
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-abiword
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-amaya
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-anon-proxy
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-apache
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-apache2
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-apachetop
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-apt
/home/skx/Maildir/debian-packages-apt-listchanges
```

Flags can be used to refine the output, for example:

* `-short` to view only the name of the maildir itself
  * e.g. "debian-packages", "debian-packages-abiword", etc.
* `-format '${unread} ${total} ${name}'`
  * To specify what is output.
* `-unread`
  * Only show maildirs containing unread messages.


## `maildir-utils messages`

This is the star of the show!  It allows you to list the messages contained
within a maildir folder - with a flexible formatting system for output

```
$ maildir-utils messages --format '[${4flags}] ${from} ${subject}' debian-packages-ttylog
[    S] Steve Kemp <skx@debian.org> Bug#553945: Acknowledgement (ttylog: Doesn't test length of device.)

```

Here `${4flags}` was replaced by the message flags (`S` in this case), and that was padded to be four bytes long, `${from}` with the message sender, etc.

(You can also use `${file}` to refer to the filename of the message, and other header-values as you would expect.  The other magical values are "`${index}/${total}`" which show the current/total number of entries.)

You can specify either the short-path to the Maildir, beneath the root directory, or the complete path `/home/skx/Maildir/people-foo`, depending upon your preference.


## `maildir-utils ui`

This is an __extremely__ minimal UI, which allows you to navigate:

* When launched you'll be presented with a list of Maildir folders.
* Scrolling up/down works as expected.
* Pressing return will open the maildir, replacing the view with a list of messages.
* Once again scrolling should be responsive and reliable.
* Finally you can view a message by hitting return within the list.

In each case you can return to the previous mode/view via `q`, or quit globally via `Q`.  When you're viewing a single message "`J`" and "`K`" move backwards/forwards by one message.

`vi` keys work, as do HOME, END, PAGE UP|DOWN, etc.


## `maildir-utils message`

This sub-command outputs a reasonably attractive rendering of a single message.




# TODO

* We could write a `maildir-utils reply $path` to allow composing a reply to the given message.
  * That would copy to sent-mail
  * It would also add the replied-flag to the original message.


## Plan

* [x] Allow listing maildirs with a format string
  * "`${name} ${unread} ${total}`"
* [x] Fix `maildir-utils maildirs -unread` to work.
* [x] Fix RFC2047-decoding of message-headers.
* [ ] Move the prefix-handling to a common-library.
* [ ] Move the formatting of a message-list to a common-library.
* [ ] Consider a caching-plan
* [ ] Consider how threading would be handled, or even sorting of messages.
* [x] Consider a message-view
* [x] Sketch out a console UI to prove it is even worthwhile, possible.
  * [x] Start with maildir-view
  * [x] Then allow message-list-view
  * [x] Then message-view
  * [x] Modal/Stateful
  * [x] Should essentially `exec $self $mode`
    * [ ] Cache the output to RAM?  File?
    * [ ] When to refresh?
    * [x] Display the output.  But abstract "path" from "format string"


Displaying a message is done via a text/template, like so:

```
TO: ${to}
From:${from}
Subject: ${subject}
Date: ${date}
Flags: ${flags}

${Body:Text}
${Attachment-Names}
```

But we'll need to allow the user to specify their own, and allow arbitrary
header values to be shown.  Or even toggled.
